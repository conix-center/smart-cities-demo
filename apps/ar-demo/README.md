AR Demo Code
============

The are demo code simply uses the conixsubscriber to grab all sensors 
in our origin space, then publishes them in a format that the iPad understands.

The idea is that it could be run as a sandboxed app just as any other
application running in the administrative domain. It accesses all data
through the generic subscriber API.
